# SCEQSRC

SCEQSRC is a very-small MATLAB package that implements the empirical earthquake source-scaling relations to enable Monte Carlo approach to predict the source parameter(s), i.e., magnitude, and source dimensions (rupture length, rupture width, rupture area) when either of them is provided. 
 
SCEQSRC is part of the Codes for Earthquake Rupture and ground-motion Simulation (CERS) and can be downloaded from [EQUAKE-RC](http://equake-rc.info/cers-software/).

To interprete the scaling relations it is important to understand the nomenclature: [Block diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220019340_New_insights_into_the_local_crust_structure_of_Mt_Etna_volcano_from_seismological_and_morphotectonic_data/figures?lo=1)
